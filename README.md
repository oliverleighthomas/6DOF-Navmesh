# 6DOF-Navmesh

A specialized navmesh meant to allow for six degrees of freedom through an environment.

This project is currently a WIP, but will soon be released on the Unreal asset store! You can read about my progress on my [blog](https://oliverleighthomas.github.io/blog/),
which is updated every Sunday.
